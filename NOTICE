NOTICE: USAGE AND ATTRIBUTION

This repository contains software developed for the quantification of 
2D cell migration.

Third-Party Code: The function `msd2pse0.m` and the core Persistent
Random Walk (PRW) fitting logic are derived from supplementary material
originally published by Wu et al. in Nature Protocols (2015).

Modifications: This version has been modified by the Mistriotis Lab to
include:
1. Refined parameter bounds 
2. Coefficient labels to clarify parameter bound assignments
3. Implementation of a "First-Half" MSD fitting rule

Usage: This code is provided for academic and research purposes. Users
are requested to cite both the original authors (Wu et al., 2015) and 
the paper associated with this repository (Akinpelu et al., 2026) in any 
resulting publications.
