NOTICE: USAGE AND ATTRIBUTION

This repository contains code adapted from the DeepBioVision Lab 
(originally published by Wu et al., *Nature Protocols* 2015), specifically 
the `msd2pse0.m` function and the core Persistent Random Walk (PRW) model 
fitting logic.

Modifications: This version has been modified by the Mistriotis Lab to
include:
1. Refined parameter bounds 
2. Coefficient labels to clarify parameter bound assignments
3. Implementation of a "First-Half" MSD fitting rule

Usage: This code is provided for academic and research purposes. Users
are requested to cite both the original authors (Wu et al., 2015) and 
the paper associated with this repository (Akinpelu et al., 2026) in any 
resulting publications.
